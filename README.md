# Elixir-Couch

Elixir-Couch is my attempt at a feature-complete [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) client, written in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).
It is modelled tightly after [Benoit's couchbeam library](https://github.com/benoitc/couchbeam). 
It is also a learning  experience for me, so don't expect too much for now. 
On the other hand, I _do_ plan to integrate it into some larger real-word application 
and actually use it.

The whole thing is currently not really usable since only a handful server-related api calls
are implemented. The tests work though.  Stay tuned to see the project evolve (or me failing).
