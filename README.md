# Couch

Elixir-couch is my attempt at a feature-complete Apache CouchDB client, written Elixir.
It is modelled tightly after Benoit's couchbeam library. This project is also a learning 
experience for me, so don't expect too much for now. On the other hand, I do plan to 
integrate it into some larger real-word application and actually use it.

The whole thing is not really usable currently since only a handful servre-related api calls
are implemented. Stay tuned to see the project evolve.
